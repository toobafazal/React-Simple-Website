                <p>We welcome our users to Online Quran teaching services where we are offering multiple Islamic
                    as
                    well
                    as character building and life reformation courses as per the teachings of Sharia. Thousands
                    of
                    individuals have learned to read Quran with these online Quran classes service in Pakistan
                    and

                    other countries of the globe. As Bint-e-Ather is doing its services in more than 107 walks
                    of
                    life
                    with the sole aim of propagating the teachings of Quran and Sunnah and this is another step
                    for
                    those Islamic sisters who are aged or busy in their worldly affairs but havenâ€™t learned
                    the proper recitation of Quran. We urged to all our Islamic sisters to take admission
                    in this online Quran academy and learn to read Quran properly. Being a Muslim, it is our
                    religious
                    duty that we should not only recite Quran but also try to understand every word of it and if
                    you
                    are
                    one of them who are unable to recite Quran properly then take admission in this online Quran
                    teaching service and enlighten your heart with the sacred holy book of Almighty.
